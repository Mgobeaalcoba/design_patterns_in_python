"""
Module for payment processing, notifications, and transaction logging.

This module provides classes for managing payments via the Stripe API, sending notifications through email or SMS,
and logging transaction details into a file. It also integrates tools for data simulation (`faker`) and environment
variable configuration (`dotenv`), supporting a wide range of use cases for payment workflows.

Key Features:
- **Payment Processing**: Facilitates secure and customizable payment processing via the Stripe API.
- **Notifications**: Enables sending payment confirmations via email (SMTP) and SMS (Twilio).
- **Logging**: Records transaction details, ensuring traceability.
- **Data Simulation**: Uses `faker` for generating test data.
- **Environment Management**: Leverages `dotenv` to manage sensitive credentials securely.

Dependencies:
- `os`: For environment variable access.
- `smtplib`: For sending email notifications.
- `faker`: For generating random test data.
- `stripe`: For payment processing.
- `twilio`: For SMS notifications.
- `dotenv`: For environment configuration.
- `pydantic`: For validating and managing structured data.

Usage:
This module is designed to be flexible and modular, supporting extensibility for additional payment gateways or notification systems.
